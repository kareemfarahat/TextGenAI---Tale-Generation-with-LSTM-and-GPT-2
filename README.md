# TextGenAI---Tale-Generation-with-LSTM-and-GPT-2
TextGenAI is a project that combines the power of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and GPT-2 models to generate captivating tales. It utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to train the models on a dataset of existing stories and then generates new stories based on the learned patterns and structures.
